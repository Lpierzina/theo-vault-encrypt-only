# What You Get Today
Your files are now mathematically immune to breach, ransomware, or quantum attack.

## “The only storage where breach = worthless”
Theo Vault is the world’s first ransomware-proof, quantum-immune, never-decrypts file system — the Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive killer you’ve been waiting for your entire life.

Every file you drop into Theo Vault is instantly transformed using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), chaos-perturbed via 5D quantum hypergraphs, and protected by keys that die in less than a millisecond. Even if every server is seized, every drive is stolen, or a quantum computer breaks every legacy system on Earth — your data remains perfectly intact and completely unusable to anyone but you.

Powered by Autheo’s PrivacyNet and PQCNet, Theo Vault syncs globally, works offline-first, and runs natively on your device. No company — not even Autheo — can ever read your files. Not now. Not in 2050. Not ever.

- For individuals: your photos, medical records, and memories are finally safe.
- For enterprises: your IP, customer data, and classified documents are finally untouchable.
- For governments: Tier-5 SCIF-grade storage is finally possible in the cloud.

Theo Vault isn’t just secure storage.
It is the end of the era of data breaches, ransomware, and surveillance capitalism.
Welcome to the sovereign internet.
Your vault is ready.
